    Audio Book Player by offer0, OCT 2022 (v1)

    ***    REQUIREMENTS    ***
    A folder named AudioBooks in the main folder (where index.html is):
    If you dont want your audio book collection in the main folder,
        you can add a folder link called AudioBooks instead (the way my home version is set up) - No vhosts needed!
    Inside that folder is where you put each book folder.
    ie ./AudioBooks/[Book Name]
    eg ./AudioBooks/Aliens  --- inside which are 1) audio book files and/or 2) more (sub)folders

    PHP is used to get the folder listings
    *** END OF REQUIREMENTS ***

    The audio book player was created using Phaser 3.55.2
    It currently runs at 2560x1440
    V1.x+ will allow it to runs at half resolution as older iGPUs die under the stress
    The option is there to remove fade in and fade outs as theyre very intensive
